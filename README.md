This has been test on Ubuntu 12.04, with ROS Hydro, and Gazebo 3
While the CrowdDrone algorithms are expected to work on system, the ROS/Gazebo environment can be a little picky.

Requirements:
ROS Hydro: http://wiki.ros.org/hydro
Gazebo v3: http://gazebosim.org/
ARDrone Autonomy: https://github.com/AutonomyLab/ardrone_autonomy
Tum Simulator: https://github.com/ElliotSalisbury/tum_simulator/tree/gazebo3
